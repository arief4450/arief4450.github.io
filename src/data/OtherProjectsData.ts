                This my tries to make <strong>Minecraft in Unity.</strong> My first experimental takes on how to apply procedural generation of assets and making a terrain chunks, a minecraft concept on how they make thousand of unique blocks on single render. 
                <br/> This was using terrain chunks - which is what the actual minecraft does as far as I can tell. This meant using voxel data to only build faces of blocks that are facing air blocks. And because the voxel data is 3D, it's possible to have much more interesting procedural terrain generation, like caves, overhangs, trees, etc.
                <br/> Procedurally generating trees and water were both a little tricky. For trees, I used a perlin noise value at each chunk coordinate to determine how many trees would be in each chunk. Then, a random number generator seeded with the chunk's coordinates was used to build the specific trees. This way, the exact same random numbers are produced each time for a specific chunk, and the same trees are generated.
                <br/> As i said, this thing is still on development as i'm not implement how to interact with the map yet

                <strong>Simple FPS Multiplayer</strong> is my very first attempt at creating Unity Multiplayer feature. The way it works is simple, at the time i made this i've experimenting with local multiplayer first, which means that the players that want to play this must be on the same network and the player must host a room first so another player can join their room. Aside from multiplayer aspect, this game is just provide a simple run and gun gameplay.
